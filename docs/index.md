## Local Development Set Up

### Virtual Environment
This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management.
`poetry` created a brand new virtual environment isolated from the globale Python installation.
By default it  uses the Python version used during its installation.

To create and/or spawn a shell within the project's virtual environment use the following command:
```bash
poetry shell
```

To exit the shell run:
```bash
exit
```

### Documentation
The project documentation uses Github Pages. The site is currently being built from the `/docs` folder in the `main` branch.
